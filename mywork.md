# Work Projects
- I own the [Prefect website](https://www.prefect.io) and led a rebuild and redesign in mid-2023, deploying all new messaging & positioning
- [datastack.design](https://datastack.design/er) was a fun viral project we built
- I created [Prefect's Growth Framework](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-01-13-navigating-ambiguity/), a way of prioritizing our marketing and product efforts
- I built the [Prefect activation metric](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-03-14-activation-metric/), which is used to measure how engaged Prefect's users are
- See here for the [tech stack](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-06-23-growth-tech-stack/) I helped to build at Prefect for marketing purposes
- I created [Club 42](https://discourse.prefect.io/t/the-third-launch-week-initiative-announcing-ambassador-program-called-club-42/500), Prefect's ambassador program

# Writing
- My [personal blog](https://chrisreuter.me), where recently I write about things like [usage-based pricing](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-02-16-usage-pricing/)
- My [Medium](https://medium.com/@csreuter), where I previously wrote for Tellius. For example, [The amazing technology behind Tellius elasticity](https://medium.com/@csreuter/the-amazing-technology-behind-tellius-elasticity-839c896ddc60) or [Building & tuning ML models in Tellius](https://medium.com/@csreuter/building-and-tuning-ml-models-in-tellius-d969148de113)
- Some examples from prefect.io, including [landing pages](https://www.prefect.io/data-engineers), [case studies](https://www.prefect.io/blog/rec-room-case-study), [tutorials](https://www.prefect.io/blog/schedule-your-code-quickly-with-flow-dot-serve), and blogs [[1](https://www.prefect.io/blog/a-platform-approach-to-workflow-orchestration),[2](https://www.prefect.io/blog/what-is-a-data-pipeline)] (some of which are ghost written).

# Videos
In 2020-2021 I created a series of videos for Tellius:
- [HR Analytics video, 25k organic views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3LtFddamc)
- [Tellius + Snowflake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUpGzu-Has)
- [Customer Churn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7neKxRMSBM)

I also host [PrefectLive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZfWmQS5hVzH_jd7ovYo0hGaG4gX0Wzws), a weekly livestream series with Prefect.
