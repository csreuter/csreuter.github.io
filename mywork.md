I also hosted [PrefectLive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZfWmQS5hVzH_jd7ovYo0hGaG4gX0Wzws), a weekly livestream series in 2022 with Prefect.

# Work Projects

- See here for the [tech stack](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-06-23-growth-tech-stack/) I helped to build at Prefect for marketing purposes
