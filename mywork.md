# Work Projects
## Resourcely
- Report to the CEO as the first marketer
- I built [Resourcely's](https://www.resourcely.io) messaging platform, wrote 99% of our website copy, and led the redesign of our website along with some great partners
- Working with my GTM colleagues (CEO and Head of Sales), built and iterated on our ideal customer profile understanding. Interview customer and prospects constantly.
- Work closely with our engineers, helping to steer product direction
- Manage our customer-facing [documentation](https://docs.resourcely.io)
- Established our newsletter, Securely Sourced
- Implemented marketing ops tooling, including one of my favorites - [customer.io](https://www.customer.io). With this we automate email marketing and a variety of internal workflows (such as triaging product signups)

## Prefect
- Reported to the CRO and eventually the COO
- I owned the [Prefect website](https://www.prefect.io) and led a rebuild and redesign in mid-2023, deploying all new messaging & positioning
- [datastack.design](https://datastack.design/er) was a fun viral project we built
- I created [Prefect's Growth Framework](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-01-13-navigating-ambiguity/), a way of prioritizing our marketing and product efforts
- I built the [Prefect activation metric](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-03-14-activation-metric/), which is used to measure how engaged Prefect's users are
- See here for the [tech stack](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-06-23-growth-tech-stack/) I helped to build at Prefect for marketing purposes
- I created [Club 42](https://discourse.prefect.io/t/the-third-launch-week-initiative-announcing-ambassador-program-called-club-42/500), Prefect's ambassador program

# Writing
- My [personal blog](https://chrisreuter.me), where recently I write about things like [usage-based pricing](https://chrisreuter.me/2023-02-16-usage-pricing/)
