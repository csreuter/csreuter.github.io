I invest in early-stage technology companies as an individual angel investor. I also am on the hunt for cash-flowing businesses in the Northeastern US as a member of Backwoods Capital, an investment collective based in Maine. Below are some of the companies I've had the privilege to invest in:

## [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io)
**Modern workflow orchestration for data teams**

Prefect is building the new standard in dataflow automation, focused on the modern data stack. I joined Prefect as an employee, helping scale their product-led growth motion from startup to Series A and beyond. Their approach to workflow orchestration solves real problems I experienced firsthand in data engineering.

## [Resourcely](https://www.resourcely.io) 
**Cloud infrastructure guardrails that don't get in the way**

## [Tellius](https://www.tellius.com)
**AI-powered business intelligence and augmented analytics**

## [CourseStorm](https://www.coursestorm.com)
**Continuing education management platform**

## [Rely AI](https://www.tryrely.ai)
**AI-powered prop-tech intelligence platform**

## [Alivo AI](https://www.alivo.ai)
**AI-driven sales agents for home services companies**
