I invest in early-stage technology companies as an individual angel investor. I also am on the hunt for cash-flowing businesses in the Northeastern US as a member of Backwoods Capital, an investment collective based in Maine. Below are some of the companies I've had the privilege to invest in:

## [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io)
**Modern workflow orchestration for data teams**

## [Resourcely](https://www.resourcely.io) 
**Cloud infrastructure guardrails that don't get in the way**

## [Tellius](https://www.tellius.com)
**AI-powered business intelligence and augmented analytics**

## [CourseStorm](https://www.coursestorm.com)
