Iâ€™m currently VP of Marketing at [CloudQuery](https://www.cloudquery.io). I invest in a variety of companies: I am an investor in early-stage technology companies as an individual angel, and I'm a member of an investment collective based in Maine called Backwoods Capital with some of my close friends.

I like Maine (the US State), software & analytics, woodworking, hiking, travel, and spending time with my wife & dog.

**CloudQuery 2025-Present**

I joined CloudQuery as VP of Marketing to help them scale their marketing motion. CloudQuery helps teams understand all of their cloud assets with a unified SQL-queryable view spanning AWS, GCP, Azure, and hundreds of other SaaS sources.

**Resourcely 2024-2025**

I joined Resourcely as lucky number 13. I built the marketing motion from scratch, including:

- Positioning & messaging

- GTM motion
- Tons of content

- Marketing ops & automation

**Prefect 2021-2024**

I joined Prefect in late 2021 as Head of Growth and number 33, where I continued to learn about PLG, GTM models and company strategy. I started with a focus on growth marketing and demand generation, and ended being responsible for product marketing: positioning, messaging, and ICPs.

**Tellius 2020-2021**

I joined Tellius in early 2020 and was there for 18 months. I learned about GTM models, selling and sales process, and pivoting from sales-led to product-led.

**IBM 2012-2020**

I worked at IBM from 2012 until the end of 2019. I was involved in corporate finance, budgeting & planning for 2 years. I then transitioned into pricing roles, both strategic (for the Netezza acquisition) and transactional (ELA pricing). I then moved into GTM and sales roles.
